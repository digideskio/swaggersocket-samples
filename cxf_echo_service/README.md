Apache CXF JAXRS SwaggerSocket echo service using Spring
=================================================

This demo illustrates how to develop a simple CXF jaxrs based
service that can be invoked using SwaggerSocket. SwaggerSocket is
a protocol that allows any existing REST services to be invoked
over WebSocket. See further information on SwaggerSocket at its
project page at
[https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket)

This demo uses CXF's integrated Atmosphere feature where you can attach
the SwaggerSocket protocol interceptor to the CXF bus in its configuration file [context.xml](osgi_cxf_echo_service/src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/context.xml). The echo service itself is from the echo service of the SwaggerSocket samples [https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket/tree/master/samples/swaggersocket-cxf-echo](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-socket/tree/master/samples/swaggersocket-cxf-echo).


Building
--------
From the base directory of this sample, the pom.xml file
is used to build and run the standalone unit test.

```bash
  mvn clean install
```

Running the demo
------------------------
You can use the embedded jetty to run this demo by running the following command.

```bash
mvn jetty:run
```

#### Testing this demo

Using Browser, open [http://localhost:8080/RestContext/swaggersocket_echo/](http://localhost:8080/RestContext/swaggersocket_echo/) to go to this sample's echo page.

Enter some text and publish it to the server. You can choose the operation implemented by the echo service.

The following operations are implemented:

* echo: a POST service that returns the input message. There are special messages: "secret" 
  triggers an exception and "sleep n" sleeps for n seconds before returning the response.
* ohce: a POST service that returns the reversed input message.
* xbox: a GET service that returns an XML enveloped response.
* jbox: a GET service that returns an JSON enveloped response.
* put: a PUT service that returns no response content.

To observe the detailed interaction, you can go to the [fallback page](http://localhost:8080/RestContext/swaggersocket_echo/fallback), which can display each SwaggerSocket messages that are sent and received.

You can also try the node.js client of sample [echo-nodjs](../echo-nodejs/README.md) with the target URL: http://localhost:8080/RestContext/swaggersocket_echo
